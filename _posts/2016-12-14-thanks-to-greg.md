We’re excited for [Greg’s new position as a Computer Science Education Lead at Shopify](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2016/12/next-steps.html), where he will help with their CS education partnerships and enthusiastic to see where his creativity, passion, commitment and hard work take him next. There aren’t words to express the gratitude we have for everything Greg has done and his tireless work on behalf of better research software practices that have an impact on how we do research everyday. While this was the initial goal, along the way Greg created an ethos of collaborative and open lesson development, of teaching shared curriculum, of learning to be a better teacher and most of all he created a community of people who are excited to work together. He made those of us who felt alone in our labs working in programming or data analysis feel like we weren’t alone and that we were connected to other people who shared our enthusiasm for data and code and our passion to share that perspective with others. When we did a survey of instructors, the most common reason people said they wanted to become instructors is because they talked to Greg. Greg has collectively and individually inspired over 700 instructors that we have today as well as countless learners in any of the workshops that he’s taught. He’s made us feel like we can do more than we thought and that we had something important to contribute. For Data Carpentry, he is the one who encouraged us to scale it beyond an initial few workshops and make it a Carpentry and was on the Steering Committee for the crucial time of getting it off the ground. We’re sure there are so many other stories from people who Greg inspired to be bold and create something new and go after something that was valuable but difficult.


As much as Greg came from the code world, he has always cared first about people. He will advocate for everyone else he knows before himself. He wants to make it a better world by giving more people a chance to participate and be heard. We’re so glad that Greg is going to continue to be a part of the community teaching some workshops and instructor trainings. Those of you lucky enough to be in his classes will get to hear all his stories first hand, but you’ll see his passion and commitment to helping others through the instructors in all of the workshops and the program that he has built.


We know you have your own stories and want to thank Greg, so please send him an email, leave comments here or in true SWC fashion create an issue in the [joint 'conversations' repo](https://github.com/carpentries/conversations/issues/) or any other one.

All the best wishes to Greg on his new adventure!

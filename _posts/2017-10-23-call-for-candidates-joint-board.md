As most of you know, Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry are merging into a
new organization, provisionally called "The Carpentries". This new organization
will officially begin on January 1, 2018, with a hugely talented staff and
dedicated community already in place.

This is an exciting time, and we are looking for people who want to  help direct
the new organization by being an elected member of the Board of Directors of The
Carpentries. The board will include both appointed and elected members in order
to balance community engagement with needed expertise in leading a growing
non-profit organization. For more information about the responsibilities and
composition of the board, see [this
issue](https://github.com/carpentries/2017Merger/blob/master/RFCs/RFC2.md), part
of the merger RFC.  

If you are a qualified instructor who has taught at least twice in the past two
years, or have done non-teaching work for the community, you can both stand for
election and vote. Please visit the [list of current SCF
members](https://software-carpentry.org/scf/members/) to see who is eligible to
stand and vote in our election. We are updating this list to reflect Data
Carpentry as well. If you believe you qualify as a member but are not listed,
please [contact us](mailto:admin@carpentries.org) as soon as possible.

In order to stand for election we request that you write a blog post that
introduces yourself to the community. The post:

* must be about 500 words and can be written in any format (question and answer, paragraph etc.)
* must be titled "2018 Election: Your Name"
* must be submitted by December 1, 2017

You can submit your post as a pull request to either the [SWC website
repository](https://github.com/swcarpentry/website), the [DC website
repository](https://github.com/datacarpentry/datacarpentry.github.io) or [by
email](mailto:admin@carpentries.org). In the post, you should explain:

* your previous involvement with The Carpentries
* what you would do as a member of the Board of Directors to contribute to the growth and success of the community

Candidates will be given the opportunity to share their thoughts with our
community, including ideas for continued involvement, at our two community
meetings on November 16, 2017.

**Timeline for election:**

* October 23: nominations open
* November 16: nominees can introduce themselves on community calls
* December 1: nominations close
* December 4-8: community votes on candidates

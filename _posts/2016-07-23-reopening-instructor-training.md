For the last ten months,
the [Software Carpentry Foundation](http://software-carpentry.org/scf/) has worked toward three goals
for its instructor training program:

1.  Make the content more relevant.

2.  Increase the number of people able to deliver instructor training.

3.  Find a format that meets everyone's needs in a sustainable way.

They have made a lot of progress on all three,
and are therefore now able to offer instructor training once again
to people who aren't affiliated with our partner organizations.
If you wish to apply to take part
in one of the two open-enrollment classes we will offer this fall,
please fill in the form at:

<https://amy.software-carpentry.org/workshops/request_training/>

to tell them about yourself,
what excites you about teaching,
and how Software and Data Carpentry can help in your community.
They will notify applicants as spaces become available.
If you have any questions,
please mail
[training@software-carpentry.org](mailto:training@software-carpentry.org).

Please note that as a condition of taking this training, you must:

*   abide by our code of conduct, which can be found at
    <http://datacarpentry.org/code-of-conduct/> and
    <http://software-carpentry.org/conduct/>,

*   agree to teach at a Data Carpentry or Software Carpentry workshop
    within 12 months of the course,
    and

*   complete three short tasks after the course in order to complete certification.
    The tasks take a total of approximately 8-10 hours,
    and are described at
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/checkout/>.

If you would like to accelerate the process,
check out our [Partnership program](http://www.datacarpentry.org/partnerships/).
Organizational partners make ongoing commitments to supporting our organization
and are prioritized for instructor training.
If you need help making the case at your organization,
please [mail us](mailto:partnerships@software-carpentry.org):
we'd be happy to chat.

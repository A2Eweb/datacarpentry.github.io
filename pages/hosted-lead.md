Lead instructors are responsible for co-ordinating with co-instructors and the host about the curriculum. They are also responsible for setting up the workshop's web page and for distributing learner surveys. All of these duties can be delegated, but it's the lead instructor's responsibility to make sure they are done. If you've been assigned the lead instructor role, but aren't comfortable with it, or find that you don't have the time, let the [Data Carpentry workshop coordinator](mailto:admin@datacarpentry.org) know as soon as possible (admin@datacarpentry.org).


The lead instructor is also responsible for preparing to teach the material - see the [Instructor checklist](/instructor-checklist/) for details.

## Before the workshop:  
- [ ] With the workshop host and your co-instructors, decide on your [curriculum](/workshops/}, the order of lessons and who will teach each lesson  
- [ ] Create an Etherpad for your workshop at http://pad.software-carpentry.org/YYYY-MM-DD-site (where "YYYY-MM-DD-site" is the ID of your workshop)
- [ ] [Set up your workshop website](https://github.com/datacarpentry/workshop-template)  
- [ ] Send your website repositoryâ€™s URL to the [Data Carpentry workshop coordinator](mailto:admin@datacarpentry.org) (admin@datacarpentry.org)  
- [ ] Assist the workshop host with [recruiting helpers](/email-templates/#recruiting-helpers) (at least 1 per 12 participants)  
- [ ] Coordinate with the host to ensure the workshop is [accessible](/accessibility/)  
- [ ] [Prepare to teach your material](/instructor-checklist/) 

## During the workshop:  
- [ ] Ensure that attendee names and emails are collected at workshop
- [ ] Send out the [post-workshop survey](/email-templates/#email-learners-after-workshop) (it's best to do this at the very end of the workshop)  

## After the workshop:  
- [ ] Coordinate with the host to send information on workshop attendance to [Data Carpentry workshop coordinator](mailto:admin@datacarpentry.org) (admin@datacarpentry.org)  
- [ ] Complete the same post-workshop instructor tasks as the [other instructors](/instructor-checklist/)

Share your thoughts on Twitter @swcarpentry and @datacarpentry.  

#### Community News  
**Thank you Greg!** - We want to express our sincere thank you to Greg Wilson for his tireless work toward making Software and Data Carpentry what they are today. We’ve come a long way from the initial idea back when Greg was a post-doctoral researcher to a global network of hundreds of certified instructors. We’re now a global movement of researchers striving better the way data-driven research is done. We want to express our deepest thanks to Greg as he [moves on to new opportunities and challenges](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2016/12/next-steps.html) at Shopify. We hope to still see you around now and again Greg.  

**Software Carpentry Election Underway** - The Software Carpentry 2017 Steering Committee election is underway. Look for ballots from electionbuddy in your email inbox. The polls close on Friday January 27th, so get your vote in. We have an [amazing slate of candidates](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/01/election-update.html).  

**New mentors/mentees program** - A huge thanks to the many Carpentry instructors who have signed up as mentors for the new Mentoring Program. We now have 38 mentors ready to share their experience with new instructors and help them prepare for their first few workshops. If you’re a Carpentry instructor who has taught one or fewer workshops and would like to join the program as a mentee, please sign up [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSepZJL1oD3GPbNCBJeU0hsWJ_hokxMHMQ0bsd1o0V8uSeWKgg/viewform). Space is limited, so sign up soon!  

**Learning Objectives for Ecology Lessons** - Maintainers and collaborators for Data Carpentry’s Ecology Lessons participated in a discussion to determine which of the learning objectives are of top priority for assessment. Contributors provided feedback via this [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uAP6wZ_m_gihOlSGsNurwSDq8SrTRCFYVyCerl2whHw/edit), and met virtually on Friday, January 13th. The conversation is not over, so if you’d like to be a part of the conversation, provide your input on the [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uAP6wZ_m_gihOlSGsNurwSDq8SrTRCFYVyCerl2whHw/edit), and/or create an issue on GitHub by January 31st. 

#### Subcommittee Activity

#### Highlights from the Software and Data Carpentry Community Calendar  

**October Community Call** - October 20th, 2016 - [Come join us](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/community-call-2016-10-20) for the community call on Thursday October 20th. We will be talking about improving assessment and other community happenings. Have a look at [last month’s notes](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/community-call-2016-09-15) if you missed the call.  

**Discussion Sessions** - Discussion session times have changed to better accommodate our global community. Two sessions are held every Tuesday alternating between 7:00, 20:00 UTC and 15:00, 23:00 UTC. They’re a great way to prepare for upcoming workshops, debrief on past ones and learn from others in the community. Information about upcoming sessions can be found on the [discussion etherpad](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/instructor-discussion), sign up for one if you’re recently taught or want to reconnect with carpentries instructors. If you are an experienced instructor, having taught 3 or more times, please consider signing up to [lead a session](http://lists.software-carpentry.org/pipermail/mentoring/2016-September/000726.html). Want to learn more, get on the [mentoring email list](http://lists.software-carpentry.org/pipermail/mentoring/) or join a [mentoring meeting](http://software-carpentry.org/join/#calendar) details are on the community calendar  

**Community Calendar** - with so many activities and subcommittee meetings, we’ve begun to keep a [community calendar](http://software-carpentry.org/join/#calendar) up-to-date. Consider subscribing to the calendar so you can participate in the activities and events that interest you.  


#### Community News  

- **New Announcements List** - We’ve created an [announcements list](http://eepurl.com/cfODMH) to better communicate with community members. You can expect a monthly newsletter and periodic and timely community announcements on this list. It is meant to be the canonical source for information from both of Data and Software Carpentry. Feel free to share the [signup link](http://eepurl.com/cfODMH) with interested parties.  

- **Special Election on Software Carpentry Steering Committee rules** - See the following blog post [on rules for SWC Steering Committee](http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2016/09/election-procedures.html) voting. This minor tweak serves to ensure that the Software Carpentry Steering Committee continuity is preserved in cases where a large number (or all) Steering Committee members change in an election.  

- **2017 Software Carpentry Steering Committee Election** - It is time to start thinking about the Steering Committee Election coming up in early 2017. If you’re interested in serving on the steering committee, start thinking about a blog post to share your vision for the future of Software Carpentry. We’ll have an official call for blog posts in December and the deadline for them will be in early January. The election will follow 30-days after blog posts from candidates are submitted.

********

### October 2016

This newsletter highlights several new and exciting accomplishments we’d like the community to be aware of. Share your thoughts on Twitter @swcarpentry and @datacarpentry.

#### Highlights from the Software and Data Carpentry Community Calendar  

**Mentoring Subcommittee Meeting** - We are excited to announce that the mentoring subcommittee will meet on November 14th and 28th. [Be a part](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/scf-mentoring) of this growing group of passionate leaders. To learn more subscribe to the [mentoring email list](http://lists.software-carpentry.org/pipermail/mentoring/). We want to hear from you.  

**November Community Call** - [Join us](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/community-call-2016-11-17) November 17th for our next community call. We will be talking about the experience of teaching Software and Data Carpentry lessons and modules to undergraduates. Do our lessons resonate with that population, what if any changes might need to be made to serve that audience better? If you missed last month’s community call, we had a great discussion on assessment and ways to support learners post-workshop here are the [notes](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/community-call-2016-10-20).  

**Instructor Discussion Sessions** - Want to prepare for an upcoming workshop, discuss previous workshops, and learn from the community? Participate in one of the many instructor discussion sessions. These sessions are held every Tuesday alternating between 7:00, 20:00 UTC and 15:00, 23:00 UTC. Information about upcoming sessions can be found on the [discussion etherpad](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/instructor-discussion). Additionally, you’re always encouraged to [lead a session](http://lists.software-carpentry.org/pipermail/mentoring/2016-September/000726.html). 

**Community Calendar** - We keep an up-to-date [community calendar](http://software-carpentry.org/join/#calendar) for your convenience. Subscribe to the calendar to participate in the activities and events that interest you.  


#### Community News
**Partnership with NSBE** - Data and Software Carpentry partnered with the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) on the Code Success @ NSBE program to offer Coding Bootcamps in Norfolk, VA and Atlanta, GA early next month. NSBE is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization founded in 1975. NSBE’s mission is “to increase the number of culturally responsible Black Engineers who excel academically, succeed professionally and positively impact the community.” Code Success @ NSBE is a Google grant program aimed at increasing the number of Black engineers in the field of Computer Science. Data and Software Carpentry is proud to have been selected to offer lessons on the Unix shell, Python, and Git.  

**Assessment of Data Carpentry Workshop Impact** - Data Carpentry workshops have had a significant impact on learners. An analysis of Data Carpentry post-workshop surveys has been published on the Data Carpentry [website](http://www.datacarpentry.org/assessment/), and an interactive report is located [here](https://magic.piktochart.com/output/17303250-data-carpentry-community-call-assessment).

### September 2016  

Welcome to the inaugural Software and Data Carpentry (together the Carpentries) newsletter. 
We are launching this newsletter to keep our community well informed around all of the various activities and opportunities in our community. We’ve had considerable growth over the past year, since January 1, 2016. 
See the final section of the newsletter for year-to-date statistics from our teaching activities.


#### Highlights from the Software and Data Carpentry Community Calendar  

**October Community Call** - October 20th, 2016 - [Come join us](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/community-call-2016-10-20) for the community call on Thursday October 20th. We will be talking about improving assessment and other community happenings. Have a look at [last month’s notes](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/community-call-2016-09-15) if you missed the call.  

**Discussion Sessions** - Discussion session times have changed to better accommodate our global community. Two sessions are held every Tuesday alternating between 7:00, 20:00 UTC and 15:00, 23:00 UTC. They’re a great way to prepare for upcoming workshops, debrief on past ones and learn from others in the community. Information about upcoming sessions can be found on the [discussion etherpad](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/instructor-discussion), sign up for one if you’re recently taught or want to reconnect with carpentries instructors. If you are an experienced instructor, having taught 3 or more times, please consider signing up to [lead a session](http://lists.software-carpentry.org/pipermail/mentoring/2016-September/000726.html). Want to learn more, get on the [mentoring email list](http://lists.software-carpentry.org/pipermail/mentoring/) or join a [mentoring meeting](http://software-carpentry.org/join/#calendar) details are on the community calendar  

**Community Calendar** - with so many activities and subcommittee meetings, we’ve begun to keep a [community calendar](http://software-carpentry.org/join/#calendar) up-to-date. Consider subscribing to the calendar so you can participate in the activities and events that interest you.  


#### Community News  

- **New Announcements List** - We’ve created an [announcements list](http://eepurl.com/cfODMH) to better communicate with community members. You can expect a monthly newsletter and periodic and timely community announcements on this list. It is meant to be the canonical source for information from both of Data and Software Carpentry. Feel free to share the [signup link](http://eepurl.com/cfODMH) with interested parties.  

- **Special Election on Software Carpentry Steering Committee rules** - See the following blog post [on rules for SWC Steering Committee](http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2016/09/election-procedures.html) voting. This minor tweak serves to ensure that the Software Carpentry Steering Committee continuity is preserved in cases where a large number (or all) Steering Committee members change in an election.  

- **2017 Software Carpentry Steering Committee Election** - It is time to start thinking about the Steering Committee Election coming up in early 2017. If you’re interested in serving on the steering committee, start thinking about a blog post to share your vision for the future of Software Carpentry. We’ll have an official call for blog posts in December and the deadline for them will be in early January. The election will follow 30-days after blog posts from candidates are submitted.  

- **Workshop at Sogang University in Seoul, South Korea**, [more info here](https://statkclee.github.io/2016-11-06-sogang/)

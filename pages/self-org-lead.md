Usually for a self-organized workshop, the lead instructor is also the host. For instances where this is not the case, the lead instructor and host should decide together how to split these responsibilities. The lead instructor is also responsible for preparing to teach the material - see the [Instructor checklist](/instructor-checklist/) for details.

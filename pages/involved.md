Data Carpentry is primarily a volunteer lesson project, and is now part of [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) 
with [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org). We work with [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org) to train instructors, and all content is developed collaboratively
by volunteers. We also have volunteer helpers at workshops and can use help on infrastructure
such as the web site or workshop coordination.

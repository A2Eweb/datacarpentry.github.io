Data Carpentry is primarily a volunteer organization. We work with [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org) to train instructors, and all content is developed collaboratively by volunteers. This page hosts information and resources for people who have gone through instructor training or are helping develop lessons. It includes information on running workshops, completing and continuing training, contributing to lessons and further volunteer opportunities.

**This page is growing. More topics coming soon!**

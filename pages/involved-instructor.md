Data Carpentry workshops are taught by trained, peer, volunteer instructors. We
work with the [Software Carpentry Foundation](http://software-carpentry.org) to develop and deliver an Instructor Training program. This program teaches instructional pedagogy as
well as the practicalities of teaching a Software or Data Carpentry workshop.

Instructors teach workshops in their local area or have the opportunity to travel to
teach. We teach workshops around the world! Once you're an instructor, we'll match you with teaching opportunities that fit your
schedule, travel interests and availability.

### How to become an instructor

_If you are already a Software Carpentry instructor or experienced educator, see information on the [FastTrack](#data-carpentry-fasttrack-instructors-application) program below._

The Software Carpentry Foundation runs the Instructor Training course for both Software and Data Carpentry.

There are two steps to becoming an instructor.  

1. **Take a Software Carpentry Foundation instructor training course**   
The training course runs over two full days and covers the basics of educational psychology, instructional design, and how to apply both to teaching Data Carpentry and Software Carpentry materials. For a preview of materials - see the [instructor training course page](https://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/).

<em>
Registration for instructor training is currently on hold while we try to clear our backlog. If you have already applied to take part, we will keep your application in queue. Registration will reopen in Summer of 2016 - please keep an eye on our blog for announcements.

2. **Complete the Data Carpentry specific checkout process**
    - Complete a guided teaching practice for one Data Carpentry lesson
    - [Submit a new exercise](/instructor-checkout-exercises/) and pass a 5 minute teaching practicum for that lesson
    - Attend and participate in an [instructor discussion session](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/instructor-discussion)

### Data Carpentry Instructors FastTrack Application

If you are interested in teaching people new to computation and data analysis,
have the skills to teach
introductory R, Python or SQL and demonstrated teaching experience as a Software
Carpentry instructor or as an instructor in another capacity, we would love to have you as an instructor!

- See more information in this blog post: [http://www.datacarpentry.org/blog/fasttrack/](http://www.datacarpentry.org/blog/fasttrack/) 

If you meet the requirements above, you can go through the FastTrack program rather than completing all of the normal requirements. Although the initial deadline was in November, we are still happily accepting FastTrack applicants. 

- Please fill out the FastTrack application:  
 [http://www.datacarpentry.org/fasttrack/](http://www.datacarpentry.org/fasttrack/)  
- and sign up for an upcoming onboarding meeting on [http://pad.software-carpentry.org/data-carpentry-instructors](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/data-carpentry-instructors)  

We are interested in instructors from all domains of research, and are particularly
working to grow our instructor pool in social sciences and digital humanities.

Data Carpentry is a sibling organization of [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org) designed to teach basic concepts, skills and tools for working more effectively with data.
<p>
In many domains of research the rapid generation of large amounts of data is fundamentally changing how research is done. The deluge of data presents great opportunities, but also many challenges in managing, analyzing and sharing data. Data Carpentry aims to teach the skills that will enable researchers to be more effective and productive. The workshop is designed for learners with little to no prior knowledge of programming, shell scripting, or command line tools.
<p>
Learning objectives for the workshops: Researchers should be able to retrieve, view, manipulate, analyze and store their's and other's data in an open and reproducible way. Researchers learn best when material is taught in their domain, so workshops will be domain-specific.
